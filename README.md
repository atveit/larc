# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

# How to play the game?

1. Open index.html in a browser (e.g. Google Chrome).

2. Use arrow keys to try to get boy up to the blue part of the screen without colliding with the red beetles.

3. If you succeed the number of winning strikes (in a row) is increased. The game starts over just as you succeed, and you get a congratulary message (that lasts for 5 seconds).

4. If you fail the strike counter is set to 0 and the game is restarted.

## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
